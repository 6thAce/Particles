# Particles

**Particles** — a collection / demo / library of particle-based visual effects for 2D/3D game projects and prototypes.

> A flexible toolkit to create and manage particle effects — such as smoke, fire, rain, magical sprites, ambient dust, and other visual effects — designed to enhance visual quality and atmosphere in your game projects.

## 📌 Purpose & Motivation

Many games rely on particle systems to bring scenes to life — adding ambience, feedback, and polish (e.g. fire, smoke, weather, magic, sparkles).  
This repo aims to provide a ready-to-use, reusable set of particle effects (or a base framework for them), so you don’t have to build everything from scratch each time.  
It can serve as a standalone demo or be integrated as a module into larger projects (for example into your game work like NorthernLights).

## 🧩 What’s Inside / Features

- A variety of particle-effect presets (smoke, fire, dust, rain, ambient particles, magic/special-effect particles — depending on what’s implemented).  
- Modular structure: easy to pick and use only what you need.  
- Support for combining multiple particle systems for richer effects (layering particles, varying parameters).  
- Example or demo scenes (if present) to preview particle effects quickly.  
- Easy customization: tweak parameters (size, speed, lifespan, color, emission rate, etc.) to fit your game’s aesthetic.
